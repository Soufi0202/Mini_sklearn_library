# Mini Sklearn Library

A lightweight library containing functions for preprocessing, model selection, ensemble methods, supervised learning, neural networks, and testing.

# Usage

****Note:
To import a module or function, you need to specify its folder in the import statement. For example:
from supervised.linear_models import LinearRegression

Examples from the code:
*Preprocessing:
from preprocessing.encoders.label_encoder import LabelEncoder

*Model Selection
from model_selection.metrics import accuracy_score

*Ensemble Methods
from ensemble.boosting import AdaBoostClassifier

*Supervised Learning
from supervised.knn import KNN

*Neural Networks
from neural_networks.perceptron import Perceptron

*Testing
For running a code we use the following syntax :
python -m tests.test_ensemble

# Documentation
For detailed documentation, you can check the docstrings in the code.
